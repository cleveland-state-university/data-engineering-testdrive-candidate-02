# Code Challenge: Student Enrollment Report Generator

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Your goal is to process and consolidate data from three different source files (`users.json`, `courses.xml`, `enrollment.csv`) to produce two final, unified summary reports. This task tests your ability to parse different file formats, merge data from multiple sources, perform data aggregation, and handle data transformation.

---

## ðŸ“– The Scenario
You are a developer on the Student Information Systems team at a university. The registrar's office needs a clean, consolidated report of all students who are **currently enrolled** in courses for the upcoming term. Your system currently stores data in three separate formats, and you need to write a script to bring them all together.

## ðŸ“‚ Input Data Files

You are provided with three files:

1.  **`users.json`**
    * **Format:** JSON
    * **Content:** Contains detailed information for each student, identified by a unique `UserID`. Includes their name, email, and other demographic data.

2.  **`courses.xml`**
    * **Format:** XML
    * **Content:** Contains detailed information for each course, identified by a unique `CourseID`. Includes the course title, description, schedule, and credit hours.

3.  **`enrollments.csv`**
    * **Format:** CSV
    * **Content:** The intersection file that links users to courses. It contains the `UserID`, `CourseID`, and the status of the enrollment action.

## ðŸ’» The Task

Write a program, in the language of your choice, that performs the following actions:

1.  **Read and Parse:** Ingest data from the three provided source files.
2.  **Filter:** Identify only the records where the student is actively **enrolled**. The `EnrollmentCode` 'E' signifies an enrolled status. Records with 'W' (Withdrawn) or 'D' (Dropped) should be ignored for the final report.
3.  **Combine and Aggregate:** For each valid enrollment record, combine information from all three files. You will need to look up user details using `UserID` and course details using `CourseID`.
4.  **Generate Output:** Create **two separate CSV files**: `enrollment_summary.csv` and `course_summary.csv`.

### Output File 1: `enrollment_summary.csv`

This file should provide a summary of each student's total enrolled credit hours. Each row represents a unique student.

**Columns:**

| ColumnName | Description | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `UserID` | The unique identifier for the user. | `users.json` |
| `UserFullName` | The user's first and last name combined. | `users.json` |
| `UserEmail` | The user's email address. | `users.json` |
| `UserDateOfBirth` | The user's date of birth. | `users.json` |
| `UserAddress` | The user's full address, concatenated. | `users.json` |
| `TotalCreditHours` | The sum of credit hours for all courses the user is actively enrolled in. | `courses.xml` & `enrollments.csv` |

**Sample Row:**

```csv
UserID,UserFullName,UserEmail,UserDateOfBirth,UserAddress,TotalCreditHours
99999,"Jane Doe","jane.doe@example.edu","1999-05-21","123 Oak St, Springfield, IL, 62704",12
```

### Output File 2: `course_summary.csv`

This file should provide a summary of enrollment counts for each course. Each row represents a unique course.

**Columns:**

| ColumnName | Description | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CourseID` | The unique identifier for the course. | `courses.xml` |
| `CourseTitle` | The full title of the course. | `courses.xml` |
| `TermCode` | The code for the academic term. | `courses.xml` |
| `EnrolledStudentCount` | The total number of students actively enrolled in the course. | `enrollments.csv` |

**Sample Row:**

```csv
CourseID,CourseTitle,TermCode,EnrolledStudentCount
ABC-101,"Introduction to Fictional Studies","FA2025",88
```
